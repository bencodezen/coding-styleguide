## Things I Like

### Fractal
- Consistent header navigation that tucks away the main navigation for full page view
- Use of expand collapse for menu items since components can become numerous
- Resizable preview window for the component being viewed
- Tabs for
	- HTML
	- View (i.e., Template Version of Markup)
	- Assets (i.e., Styles / CSS and where it comes from)
	- Info: Talks about where it's referenced and how it's used in different organisms / molecules
	- Notes section
